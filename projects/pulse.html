                <a href="//social.ufhealth.org" class="organization-link organization-link_orange">Pulse</a> is a web application built off of Laravel that provides an entry point for anyone to see the variety of social media accounts that UF Health has. <a href="//social.ufhealth.org" class="organization-link organization-link_orange">Pulse</a> was the first project that I worked on for <a class="organization-link organization-link_blue" href="http://webservices.ufhealth.org" target="_blank">UFHealth</a>. Through it, I learned the fundamentals of both front and back-end development. Although it was very challenging getting set up, the rewards were entirely worth it.

                <a href="//social.ufhealth.org" class="organization-link organization-link_orange">Pulse</a> was built on the back-end using a PHP framework known as Laravel. Laravel is incredible and was just starting to emerge as a viable PHP framework when I started the project. Through it, I was able to learn about various web fundamentals such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTTP Request</li>
                <li>Routing</li>
                <li>Model-View-Controller</li>
                <li>Templating (Specifically Blade Templates)</li>
                <li>Databases</li>
                <li>Caching</li>
                <li>Authentication</li>
                <li>And so much more</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="article-section_test">
                Overall, Laravel is what bootstrapped my entire desire to learn more about web technologies and I'm extremely grateful that I was allowed to use it on my first project. After watching countless Jeffrey Way videos, I felt that I delivered a product that was worth talking about.

            <p class="article-section_text">
                Masonry is a JavaScript visual framework that I used to present the front page of the application. When the Web Services team was drafting requirements for this project, one of the main features that they wanted was a responsive layout for the variety of sizes posts.
